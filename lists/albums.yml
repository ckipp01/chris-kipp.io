  This year I'm attempting to track all the new albums I listen to. The idea is
  pretty simple. Every time I listen to a new album in its entiretiy that was
  released in 2023 and that I enjoy (considered at least a 3/5), then I'll
  throw it up here. Ratings are free to change throughout the year.

items:
