title: Album ratings for 2023
description: >
  This year I'm attempting to track all the new albums I listen to. The idea is
  pretty simple. Every time I listen to a new album in its entirety that was
  released in 2023 and that I enjoyed, then I'll throw it up here. Albums of
  the same rating are sorted by my favorite coming first. As I listen more
  throughout the year I've also already finding myself shifting things around.
  Nothing is stagnant.
