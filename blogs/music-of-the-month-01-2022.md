# Music of the Month - Jan 2022

This is the first post of a monthly series I'd like to do where I share the
music I've enjoyed over the past month. My music tastes are all over the place
and I've found that it's often a good picture of my mood that month, what I've
been going through, or just what I've been enjoying. These won't necessarily be
new albums or songs, but whatever I find myself listening to a lot during the
month. At the end of the month I'll pick an album I felt left a mark and a song
that has been my "favorite". Give it a listen, and let's talk music.

## Album of the Month

My album of the month for January is _It's Nice Outside_ by Anti-Lilly &
Phoniks. This album came out of nowhere for me. I wasn't aware of them at all
before this month and I don't even remember how I got turned onto it. I heard
_Every Season_ first, and then I was hooked. The entire album just rattles
through making it through tough times and coming out of the other side. The
lyrics are raw, but balanced with Anti-Lilly's positive outlook. This is such a
fantastic album.

## Song of the Month

A song that I found made me pause almost every time it came on this month was
_A-001_ by Corntuth off their album _Music to Work To_. January is also a pretty
reflective month for me as I look back at the previous year and plan for the
current. This song definitely facilitated some of that for me this month.

_See you next month_
