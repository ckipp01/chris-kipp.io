# Music of the Month - June 2022

I've been seemingly just living in the land of Jazz lately, because this month
will again be filled with some incredible Jazzyish tunes. I've also been
pleasantly surprised recently at the others in my tech circle that also seem to
enjoy jazz. This has been a fun intersection for me.

## Album of the Month

Like last month, I made a new discovery this month that blew my mind. There was
[an album](https://skulisverrisson.bandcamp.com/album/the-box-tree) I came
across called _Box Tree_ by Skúli Sverrisson and Óskar Guðjónsson. While it's
not the focus of this month it's a beautiful album nonetheless, and it
introduced me to the playing of Óskar Guðjónsson. While exploring his work I was
introduced to [ADHD](https://adhdiceland.com/), and was just blown away. Their
album _Adhd 7_ is the album of the month for me this month.

They played a live show for KEXP that was also incredible. It's rare for me to
just sit and watch a recorded show in its entirety, but I did for this.

## Song of the Month

The song of the month for me comes off of the album _Box Tree_ I mentioned up
above by Skúli Sverrisson and Óskar Guðjónsson. The song is _For Seconds at a
Time_, which is the first one I heard off the album. Starts off real simple, and
then just coddles you into relaxation when the Sax comes in. Such a beautiful
song.
