# Music of the Month - May 2022

This month was one of those months were you find a new piece of music and you
basically listen to it the entire month. [Vega Trails](https://vegatrails.com/),
I love you.

## Album of the Month

I discovered this duo this month by total happen chance. [Vega
Trails](https://vegatrails.com/) is made up of double-bassist and composer Milo
Fitzpatrick from [Portico Quartet](https://www.porticoquartet.com/) and Jordan
Smart from [Mammal Hands](http://mammalhands.com/). The music these two have
made in their first album together, _Tremors in the Static_, is simply magical.
I haven't been touched this much by an album in quite some time. The recording
if phenomenal, the pieces are passionate, and the range and depth that is
created just by the two of them surprises me every time I listen.

They did a filming of this in St Thomas's Church in London, and it equally as
fantastic. Here is a video showing a few of the songs.

## Song of the Month

A song that specifically stuck out to me this month was _Moving by Backwards_ by
SALES. I've been a fan of SALES for a while now and this is their latest single
they've recently put out. It's just good indie dreamy pop.
