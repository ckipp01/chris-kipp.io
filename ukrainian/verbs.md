# Verbs / дієсловo

## Terms

- verb - дієсловa
- infinitive - інфінітив

## Infinitives / інфінітиви

Infinitives in Ukrainian always have a -ти ending. 

## Reflexive verbs / зворотнi дієслово

Reflexive verbs are verbs where the object is the same as it's subject. These are indicated by having a -ся attached to the end of the verb.

Probably the most common phrase you'll see this with is:

> мені подобається ...

While we translate this to "I like ..." in English the literal translation is more like "to me is pleasing ...", which is why it has the reflexive form.
