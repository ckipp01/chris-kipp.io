# Verbs / дієсловo

## Terms

- verb - дієсловa
- infinitive - інфінітив

## Infinitives / інфінітиви

Infinitives in Ukrainian always have a -ти ending. 

## Reflexive verbs / зворотнi дієслово

Reflexive verbs are verbs where the object is the same as it's subject. These are indicated by having a -ся attached to the end of the verb.

Probably the most common phrase you'll see this with is:

> мені подобається ...

While we translate this to "I like ..." in English the literal translation is more like "to me is pleasing ...", which is why it has the reflexive form.

## Special Verbs

### бути - to be

бути deserves a mention here since it's either used so often or implied so often and actually omitted.

For example when we are using present tense to say that someone or something _is_ something, we always emit є, which is the conjugation for all present tense usages.

We say:

> Я хлопець.

Not:

> Я є хлопець.

The є here is implied.

We do however use it when we are signifying position, which is another common use for є.

> У мене є сестра.
> У них є друзі.

In general it may see odd to use бути here but when you're saying

> У мене є ...

You're not actually literally translating "I have..." but rather "In my possession is" with is being є.
