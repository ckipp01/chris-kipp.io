## Hard / Soft

- This matters quite a bit with conjugations.  For example we can use [[cases#Instrumental|instrumental case for nouns]] to show this. For a male noun we switch the ending to use _ом_ if the ending is hard, but _ем_ if the ending is soft.
- Notice that some are marked as _Both_ since they can change depending on the letter that follows them. 

## Some general notes

Ukrainian is an _open syllable language_ many that it follows grammar that often
has a consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel pattern. This impacts the rhythm,
spelling conventions, and general flow of speaking.

One great thing about Ukrainian is also that all letters are pronounced in a
word. So when you see a long word, there isn't a lot of guessing work about what
it will sound like since literally every letter will be pronounced.

Because of the _open syllable language_ patterns often when you see a word that
has 2 consonants together they are often foreign words that have made it into
the language. This is good to know because in a lot of cases, foreign words
aren't conjugated. For example, _кафе_ is borrowed from French, and therefore
irregardless of the function it has in the sentence, it will always just be
_кафе_.
