# Prepositions / прийменники

_A function word that typically combines with a noun phrase to form a phrase
which usually expresses a modification or predication._

## Terms

- proposition/s - прийменник/и

## з / зі

Has the meaning _from_ or _with_ depending on the context.

1. The first usage is indicating origin. Ex. з Києва
	- Note the usage of [[cases#Genitive - Родовий відмінок|genitive case]]  here when we are saying you are from a place.
2. The second usage is when it means _with_ indicated by the usage of the noun following being in the [[cases#Locative - місцевий відмінок|locative case]]. Ex.
	- з другом
	- з собаою

The determining factor of when to use з vs зі has to do the start of the word that comes after.
- When the word following starts with з, с, ш, щ, or a consonant cluster beginning with these sounds we use зі.
- For pretty much everything else just use з.
