![Me](images/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Chris. You've stumbled upon my blog and website. It's a simple place
where I write some things and hold links to other places that I'd like to
remember. You'll find me writing or working on things related to developer
tooling, primarily with Neovim and Scala, talking about music, or sharing stuff
I find interesting. I have a varied background, including growing up on a farm
in the United States and having a M.A. in International Relations. I first got
started in tech as I was finishing grad school, and I haven't really looked back since.
I'm currently located in the Netherlands working at [reflek.io.](https://www.reflek.io/)

You can take a look at the projects I work on [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ckipp01) or find me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ckipp). 

Over the years this site has taken many shapes ranging from a custom JS
framework powered site, one that fully tracked all my free time, to ultimately
the minimal shape you see it in now. It will continue to change and grow as I do.

Thanks for stopping by.

Chris
