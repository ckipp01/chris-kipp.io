Hi, I'm Chris. You've stumbled upon my blog and website. It's a simple place
where I write some things and hold links to other places that I'd like to
remember. You'll find me writing or working on things related to developer
tooling, Scala, or Neovim. Most of the time all of those together. I have a
varied background, including growing up on a farm in the United States and
having a M.A. in International Relations. I first got started in tech as I was
finishing grad school, and I haven't really looked back since. I'm currently
located in the Netherlands and working at [Lunatech](https://lunatech.nl/).

You can take a look at the projects I work on [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ckipp01), find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ckipp01), or find me streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ckipp).

Over the years this site has taken many shapes ranging from a custom JS
framework powered site, one that fully tracked all my free time, to ultimately
the minimal shape you see it in now. It will continue to change.

Thanks for stopping by.

Chris
