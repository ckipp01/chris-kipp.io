# Music of the Month - August 2022

A very busy last month. I found myself gravitating toward a lot of my favorites,
but also enjoying some new albums I stumbled across. I hope you enjoy what I
have for you this month.

## Album of the Month

For a while I listed to a ton of lofi. I've always enjoyed music without lyrics,
and lofi often fit my mood when I wanted something chill to code or relax to.
One of my favorite older lofi albums was the [Harbor
LP](https://tomppabeats.bandcamp.com/album/harbor-lp) by
[tomppabeats](https://tomppabeats.bandcamp.com/). However, they haven't released
a new full-length album in years. This was part of the reason I was so excited
to see a new album from them drop this month. _Habits_ is the album of the month
for me this month.

## Song of the Month

Last month I listed a
[Moya](https://www.chris-kipp.io/blog/music-of-the-month---july-2022) by
[Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://brainwashed.com/godspeed/) as my song of
the month. In part, that led me to listen to a ton more of GY!BE this past
month. In general, I think Efrim Menuck is just a genius. If you're a GY!BE fan
you may have also heard of [A Silver Mt.
Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thee_Silver_Mt._Zion_Memorial_Orchestra),
which is project of Menucks with some of the same members of GY!BE. The song _13
Angels Standing Guard 'Round The Side Of Your Bed_ is one of my favorites of
theirs and is the song of the month for me this month.

_See you next month_
