# Lately

March and April were pretty busy for me. Looking back, it was a whirlwind, but a
good one.

## Working at the Scala Center

![scala stairs](../images/scala-stairs.jpg)

In the last months quite a bit of my time went into planning the last Scala
Tooling Summit that happened in Lausanne, Switzerland. I wrote about this on the
Scala site
[here](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2023/04/11/march-2023-scala-tooling-summit.html).

The summit was incredible for me. For the last few years I've spent so much time
working on tooling in the Scala ecosystem without ever really meeting many of
those I rub shoulders with online. It was incredible to be around so many that
have had such a large impact on the community, both past and present. It was one
of the highlights of my "scala" career.

Some of the other work I've been focusing on is diving back into structured
diagnostics in Dotty and working towards actionable diagnostics. Here's a few
links related to this:

- [The Journey of a Dotty Diagnostic](https://youtu.be/EYOre0BGv68) - A talk I
  gave at [Scala.io](https://scala.io/) about this in Paris.
- [The written version of the talk](/blog/the-journey-of-a-dotty-diagnostic)
  if that's more your thing
- [Large progress tracker for `DiagnosticCode` and
  `DiagnosticRelatedInformation`](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14904)
- [Large progress tracker for actionable diagnostics](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/17337)
- [Contributor discussion about actionable
  diagnostics](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/roadmap-for-actionable-diagnostics/6172)

In the coming month I'll be heavily focusing on moving these forward.

## skan

![overview of skan](../images/skan-overview.png)

This last month I spent a chunk of time on writing
[skan](https://github.com/ckipp01/skan), which is a minimal terminal kanban
board. I use it to track my ongoing work, and work I'd like to do. I wrote an
article about it [here](/blog/skan-and-building-your-own-tools).

## Hardware

I _finally_ got my [Torn V3](https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn) build finished.
It took longer than I expected, I ruined one PCB in the process, and I learned a
ton. Overall a success. I still haven't nailed down the keymappings I want yet,
so I'm constantly re-flashing. That's why the cover isn't on the left hand side.
I also don't love my keys, so I plan on updating those and then taking a
non-potato quality photo. For now, enjoy this!

## Listening

Some fantastic music was released in the last couple months. So these two
recommendations couldn't be further apart, but I've listened to both of these
albums a ton this last month.

[Did you know there's a tunnel under Ocean
Blvd](https://lanadelrey.lnk.to/oceanblvdWE) is wonderful. I wasn't a Lana Del
Rey fan in the past, but this album is one of my favorites this year so far.

In a totally different vein I've also been listening to _Still Life In Decay_
by FACS on repeat.

While not a new album, I recently came across Maxime Denuc and was blown away.
Specifically this album, Nachtorn. Here's a short blurb about it:

> Nachthorn takes its name from one of the 78 stops that make up the main organ
> in St. Antonius Church in DÃ¼sseldorf. This instrument, equipped with a system
> developed by the German company Sinua, offers the possibility of controlling
> all of its keyboards and timbres via a computer. The organ thus becomes a
> powerful synthesiser. This set-up allowed me to fulfil an old dream of mine :
> to create an entirely acoustic dance music piece with the organ as sole actor.
> Oscillating between dub techno, harmonic locked grooves or after-hours pop,
> Nachhorn proposes a hypnotic music piece whose lines sketch the outline of an
> imaginary warehouse.

It's just so good.

## Watching

I'm probably late to the party here, but I've been watching and enjoying
[Narcos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2707408/) for the first time.

In the movie realm I watched [Come and
See](https://letterboxd.com/film/come-and-see/), which was a roller coaster ride
of emotions. I didn't know much about it before watching, but it's not a film
I'll ever forget.

## Traveling

Since the previous [lately post](/blog/lately-02), I've found myself in
Brussels, Newcastle, and Lausanne.

There's a building right out of the Brussels Central Station that always catches
my eye.

I was in Newcastle for work. Work is looking at expanding there, and I did some
presentations on our involvement in open source to a couple local universities.

The last night of the tooling summit we hiked up to a restaurant in Parc de
l'Hermitage for some Fondue. The route was full of hills and beautiful
buildings.
