# Music of the Month - April 2022

I missed March for no other reason than I just forgot about it. However, this
past month I had a few weeks off, and spent a good amount of time relaxing,
thinking about the future, and of course listening a to a lot of music. I found
my music all over the place this month, so I honestly could have picked a number
of albums and songs. However, here are a couple that stood out to me this month.


## Album of the Month

I listen to a fair amount of classical and 4 Seasons by Vivaldi has always been
a favorite of mine as cliche as it sounds. It was one of my favorite live
performances I've seen when visiting Paris in Saint-Chapelle, and the rendition
I'm about to suggest is just incredible. Max Richter is such a gifted composer
and beautiful human being. This past month was the ten year anniversary of his
_Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi - The Four Seasons_, which is my album of
the month this month.

Due to it being the anniversary he released some new videos of the performance
which are fantastic.

## Song of the Month

I started to listen to quite a bit of lofi when I started coding, and then led
to just me listing to a lot of lofi. I've found a lot of interesting artists out
there, but I find Mishaal really interesting since in his songs you'll find a
mix of Spanish, Arabic, and English due to his background. The song of the month
for me this month is _Kid Goku_ by Mishaal and Masked Man.

_See you next month... unless I forget again_
